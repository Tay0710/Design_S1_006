This is the code for the 3D mapping using the position calculated in the pipeline.
To update this for new samples:
    - Run x0_position_pipeline.py to update all position data.

To run:
    - Run x0_mapping_pipeline.py to generate point clouds of the ToFs and ultrasonics.

Note: to get open3d working must use python 11 or below....
