# LORA_TEST

- Currently working on T3_S3_V1_2_SX1262 using Receiver code

TODO: 
- Double check on Transceiver code
- Clean up code to only send relevant data
- Connect to wifi as well and use app as remote control via wifi and send that via LoRa


Nice to have:
- get this working on ESP32 Dev Module and TTGO if possible (unlikely)
