# Combined Samples
Sample descriptions:
- square = 1.2m x 1.2m rectangle turning 90 degrees to the right at each vertex
- line = walked the length of the tables at Ezone central, turned 180 degrees and returned to starting point before ending the recording

Note: The first and last 3 seconds of ToF and OF data should probably be ignored since the device was not parallel to the floor.
