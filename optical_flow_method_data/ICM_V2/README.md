# New ICM45686 Samples
Sample descriptions:
- "ICM45686_square.csv" = 1.2m x 1.2m rectangle turning 90 degrees to the right at each vertex
- "ICM45686_line.csv" = walked the length of the tables at Ezone central, turned 180 degrees and returned to starting point before ending the recording
- Max limits are Gyro = 125dps, and Accel = 4g
- The data does not get close to the 4g limit.
- The data HITs the Gyro limit of 125dps: (easy to spot by ctrl f and typing "125." in.) 
-         Square at 13.608-13.86
-         line at 22.145 - 22.163
