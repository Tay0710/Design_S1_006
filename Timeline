        Created point cloud from 10 data points and map them
        Attempted to create parallel lines (like left and right walls) - currently unsuccessful.
26/07 - Generated, created a point cloud and created a mesh for parallel lines.
        Generated, created a point cloud and created a mesh for two 'walls'.
28/07 - Plotted the generated data from Dorothy in 3D with 3D axis.
29/07 - Installed imufusion open-source code and copied sample data 'sensor_data.csv'
        Printed first 5 rows of data, confirmed data types of each column and ensured there were no NaN results.
