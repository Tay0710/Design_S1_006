24/07 - Set up environment
        Fake test data
25/07 - Change data format
        Created 2D plot for positions and distances
        Created point cloud from 10 data points and map them
        Attempted to create parallel lines (like left and right walls) - currently unsuccessful.
26/07 - Generated, created a point cloud and created a mesh for parallel lines.
        Generated, created a point cloud and created a mesh for two 'walls'.
28/07 - Plotted the generated data from Dorothy in 3D with 3D axis.
29/07 - Installed imufusion open-source code and copied sample data 'sensor_data.csv'
        Printed first 5 rows of data, confirmed data types of each column and ensured there were no NaN results.
        Pull the sample_rate and time_step from the data.
        Include the quaternion-based sensor fusion
        Generate the euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw)
30/07 - Pulled in open source software to test data (gait-tracking.py)
        Aquired data from Dorothy and Sam for short walks
        Attempted to change parameters from the copied library to better suit the data
        Added 2D and 3D plotting capacity to position_1_trial.py
        Attempted to plot the short_walk data in the self-done position_1_trial.py
        Create a new position_2_trial.py to run without magnometer data to match our current sensor capacity
        Create a new position_3_trial.py to try and fuse the self-done and previously written library (unsuccessful)
