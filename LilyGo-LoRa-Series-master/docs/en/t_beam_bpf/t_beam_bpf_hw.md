## Overview

* This page introduces the hardware parameters related to `LilyGo T-Beam-BPF`

### Notes on use

1. The device will not be powered when the battery is inserted for the first time, because the onboard BMS is in shipping mode at this time. You need to exit shipping mode and insert the USB-C into the board to activate the device power supply. If the battery is removed and re-inserted, you need to repeat the above steps
2. Please be sure to connect the antenna before transmitting, otherwise it is easy to damage the RF module

## PlatformIO Quick Start

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Search for the `PlatformIO` plugin in the `Visual Studio Code` extension and install it.
3. After the installation is complete, you need to restart `Visual Studio Code`
4. After restarting `Visual Studio Code`, select `File` in the upper left corner of `Visual Studio Code` -> `Open Folder` -> select the `LilyGo-LoRa-Series` directory
5. Wait for the installation of third-party dependent libraries to complete
6. Click on the `platformio.ini` file, and in the `platformio` column
7. Select the board name you want to use in `default_envs` and uncomment it.
8. Uncomment one of the lines `src_dir = xxxx` to make sure only one line works , Please note the example comments, indicating what works and what does not.
9. Click the (✔) symbol in the lower left corner to compile
10. Connect the board to the computer USB-C , Micro-USB is used for module firmware upgrade
11. Click (→) to upload firmware
12. Click (plug symbol) to monitor serial output
13. If it cannot be written, or the USB device keeps flashing, please check the **FAQ** below

## Arduino IDE quick start

1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Install [Arduino ESP32](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/)
3. Copy all folders in the `lib` directory to the `Sketchbook location` directory. How to find the location of your own libraries, [please see here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4415103213714-Find-sketches-libraries-board-cores-and-other-files-on-your-computer)
    * Windows: `C:\Users\{username}\Documents\Arduino`
    * macOS: `/Users/{username}/Documents/Arduino`
    * Linux: `/home/{username}/Arduino`
4. Open the corresponding example
    * Open the downloaded `LilyGo-LoRa-Series`
    * Open `examples`
    * Select the sample file and open the file ending with `ino`

| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| RF  Module          | SX1278 TCXO (XP02P181T)        |
| Frequency range     | 144~148MHZ                     |
| Transfer rate(LoRa) | 0.018K～37.5Kbps               |

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Note:
> 1. When testing or using, connect the antenna first, then power on to transmit the signal.
> 2. First switch the RF switch tube to the TX/RX channel, and then transmit/receive the signal: RXTX/RFMOD of the > SX127X chip is high, the RF switch
> tube is switched to the TX channel, and low, the RF switch tube is switched to the RX channel.
> 3. Control the SX127X chip, the output power is +10dBM, not exceeding +12dBm.
> 4. When the module is dormant, RXTX/RFMOD, CTL_LNA, is low. At this time, if it is a TCXO crystal oscillator, TCXO_EN is high, the module will not
> really sleep, and the TCXO crystal oscillator consumes 2.5mA. If TCXO_EN is low, all configuration parameters of > SX127X are lost, the module is truly dormant, and
> when it is started again, the SX127X needs to be reinitialized.
