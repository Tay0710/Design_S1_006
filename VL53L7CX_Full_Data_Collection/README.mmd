## ðŸ“Š Data available from `VL53L5CX_ResultsData`

### ðŸ”¹ Per-zone data (shared across all targets in that zone)

* `ambient_per_spad[]` â†’ background photon count per SPAD (IR noise).
* `nb_target_detected[]` â†’ number of detected targets in that zone (0â€“4 typically).
* `nb_spads_enabled[]` â†’ number of active SPADs used in measurement.
* `zone_id[]` (depending on driver version) â†’ zone index in the grid.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Per-target data (one entry per detected object in a zone)

* `signal_per_spad[]` â†’ return signal strength.
* `range_sigma_mm[]` â†’ statistical error of distance in millimeters.
* `distance_mm[]` â†’ measured distance to target in millimeters.
* `reflectance[]` â†’ estimated reflectivity (%) of target.
* `target_status[]` â†’ quality/status code (valid, too close, out of range, etc).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Global/frame-level metadata

* `stream_count` â†’ increments each frame (can be used as frame counter).
* `wrap_dmax_mm` â†’ maximum measurable distance before ambiguity (depends on timing budget and SPAD config).

---

## ðŸ“¦ Extra (configurable modes)

With certain configs you can also get:

* **Number of zones**: either 4Ã—4 (16) or 8Ã—8 (64).
* **Number of targets per zone**: default 1, but configurable up to 4.
* **Motion indicator** (if enabled in L5/L7 API): vector showing movement between frames.
* **Integration time**: can be set/query via API (default 20 ms).

---

âœ… So in short:

* **Zone-level fields:** ambient light, number of detected objects, number of SPADs.
* **Target-level fields:** distance, signal strength, reflectance, uncertainty, status.
* **Frame-level fields:** frame counter, max range.

Target Status Codes

| Code | Description                                                                                    |   |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| 0    | **No target detected** â€“ No valid target in the zone.                                          |   |
| 1    | **Signal too weak** â€“ Insufficient signal strength for a reliable measurement.                 |   |
| 2    | **Signal too strong** â€“ Signal saturation detected; measurement may be unreliable.             |   |
| 3    | **Out of range** â€“ Target is beyond the sensor's maximum detectable distance.                  |   |
| 4    | **Minimum range violation** â€“ Target is too close to the sensor.                               |   |
| 5    | **Valid target** â€“ Measurement is valid and reliable.                                          |   |
| 6    | **Valid target with low confidence** â€“ Measurement is valid but with reduced confidence.       |   |
| 9    | **Valid target with moderate confidence** â€“ Measurement is valid with moderate confidence.     |   |
| 13   | **Phase or signal wrap problem** â€“ Measurement failed due to phase ambiguity or signal issues. |   |
| 255  | **Invalid data** â€“ Measurement data is invalid or not available.                               |   |
